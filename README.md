# MDI2 Assignment example code
Class assignment code examples for the Android Development (MDI2) course.

## Modules
### *MDI2 101*: Introduction to Android Development
#### Social Media app
In this course, students will explore the Android ecosystem and learn the fundamental concepts required to develop Android applications. They will start with an introduction to essential tools like Android Studio and the Kotlin programming language, followed by the fundamentals for designing user interfaces using the Jetpack Compose framework. This course is structured to provide hands-on experience in building simple Android applications, guiding students from setting up the development environment to managing layouts, views, and states.

### *MDI2 102*: Programming Fundamentals - Introductory
In this introductory course, students will develop a strong foundation in programming using the Kotlin programming language. Through hands-on exercises, students will learn essential programming principles such as variables, data types, control structures, and functions. The course will emphasize applying object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts and will conclude with a brief introduction to declarative programming. By the end of the course, students will be able to build simple programs and understand the fundamental differences between imperative and declarative programming approaches.

### *MDI2 103*: Programming Fundamentals - Intermediate
In this course, students will deepen their understanding of programming concepts by working with more complex data structures such as arrays and dictionaries, while also advancing their skills in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Declarative Programming. The course will emphasize applying intermediate-level programming techniques to build efficient and scalable programs. Additionally, students will gain hands-on experience with version control systems to manage their code effectively, laying the groundwork for professional software development practices. The skills acquired in this course will lay the groundwork for the subsequent exploration of mobile and platform-specific development.
